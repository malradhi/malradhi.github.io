      Hello! My name is David and I'm an assistant professor in the
      Department of Mathematics and Statistics at American
      University. I finished a postdoctoral scholarship at the
      University of Chicago, working under <a href =
      "http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/">Matthew Stephens</a>, where I
      studied hierarchical modeling approaches to analyzing sequencing
      data. I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics at the <a href =
      "https://www.stat.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>
      under <a href =
      "https://pdhoff.github.io/">Peter
      Hoff</a>. My graduate work was on the statistical analysis of
      tensor data. You can read more about my work on
      my <a href="/research/">research</a> page. If you want to see
      any code associated with my research, check out
      my <a href="https://github.com/dcgerard">Github</a> page.
